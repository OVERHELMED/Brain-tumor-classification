    <b>Background/Objectives:</b> Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a vital role in brain tumor diagnosis by providing clear visualization of soft tissues without the use of ionizing radiation. Given the increasing incidence of brain tumors, there is an urgent need for reliable diagnostic tools, as misdiagnoses can lead to harmful treatment decisions and poor outcomes. While machine learning has significantly advanced medical diagnostics, achieving both high accuracy and computational efficiency remains challenging, particularly when external validation and calibration assessment are required for clinical translation.
    
    <b>Methods:</b> We developed a lightweight pipeline combining MobileNetV2 feature extraction with classical machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM). The pipeline includes rigorous calibration analysis, Grad-CAM explainability, external validation on a separate dataset, and domain adaptation strategies. Efficiency profiling was conducted on standard CPU hardware to assess deployment readiness.
    
    <b>Results:</b> Internal validation achieved 96.0% accuracy, 95.8% macro-F1 score, and 99.0% ROC-AUC. External validation revealed significant domain shift with performance dropping to 72.3% accuracy and 67.5% macro-F1, particularly affecting glioma detection (23% recall). Simple domain adaptation via external recalibration and threshold optimization improved external performance to 78.4% macro-F1 and 58% glioma recall. The pipeline demonstrates real-time capability with 45.7 images/second throughput, 2.22M parameters, and 8.52 MB model size.
    
    <b>Conclusions:</b> Our lightweight pipeline provides clinically relevant performance with transparent external validation, practical domain adaptation, and deployment-ready efficiency. The approach addresses key gaps in medical AI validation while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world deployment. The combination of high accuracy, explainability, and efficiency makes this pipeline suitable for clinical evaluation studies and radiologist assistance tools.

    Brain tumors represent a significant global health burden, with approximately 18.1 million new cancer cases diagnosed worldwide annually. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become the gold standard for brain tumor diagnosis due to its superior soft tissue contrast and non-invasive nature. However, the increasing complexity of brain tumor classification and the growing demand for accurate diagnostic tools have created an urgent need for automated systems that can assist radiologists in clinical decision-making.
    
    Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated remarkable success in medical image analysis, with many studies reporting accuracies exceeding 95% on internal validation sets. However, several critical limitations persist in the current literature that hinder clinical translation and real-world deployment.

This creates an overoptimistic view of real-world performance, as models often exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to external data due to domain shift, scanner differences, and population variations.
    
    <b>Calibration Assessment:</b> While classification accuracy is widely reported, the reliability of predicted probabilities—crucial for clinical decision-making—is rarely assessed. Poorly calibrated models can lead to overconfident predictions that misguide clinical decisions, particularly in high-stakes scenarios such as brain tumor diagnosis.
    
    <b>Computational Efficiency:</b> Many state-of-the-art models require substantial computational resources, limiting their deployment in resource-constrained clinical environments. The lack of comprehensive efficiency profiling in existing literature makes it difficult to assess real-world deployment feasibility.
