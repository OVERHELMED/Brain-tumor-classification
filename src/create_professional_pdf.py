    <b>Background:</b> Brain tumor classification from MRI scans is critical for clinical diagnosis, but existing deep learning approaches often lack external validation, calibration assessment, and deployment efficiency reporting—essential for clinical translation.
    
    <b>Methods:</b> We developed a lightweight pipeline combining MobileNetV2 feature extraction with classical machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM). The pipeline includes rigorous calibration analysis, Grad-CAM explainability, external validation on a separate dataset, and domain adaptation strategies. Efficiency profiling was conducted on standard CPU hardware.
    
    <b>Results:</b> Internal validation achieved 96.0% accuracy and 95.8% macro-F1. External validation revealed significant domain shift (67.5% macro-F1), particularly affecting glioma detection (23% recall). Simple domain adaptation via external recalibration and threshold optimization improved external performance to 78.4% macro-F1 and 58% glioma recall. The pipeline demonstrates real-time capability with 45.7 images/second throughput, 2.22M parameters, and 8.52 MB model size.

    Brain tumor classification from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical diagnostic task that directly impacts patient care and treatment planning. With the increasing prevalence of brain tumors and the complexity of differential diagnosis, automated classification systems have emerged as promising tools to assist radiologists in clinical decision-making.
    
    Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated impressive performance on brain tumor classification tasks, with many studies reporting accuracies exceeding 95% on internal validation sets. However, several critical gaps remain in the current literature that limit clinical translation:

    <b>Calibration Assessment:</b> While classification accuracy is widely reported, the reliability of predicted probabilities—crucial for clinical decision-making—is rarely assessed. Poorly calibrated models can lead to overconfident predictions that misguide clinical decisions.
    
    <b>Explainability and Trust:</b> The "black box" nature of deep learning models limits clinical adoption, as radiologists require interpretable explanations for AI-assisted decisions. While some studies incorporate explainability methods, quantitative assessment of explanation faithfulness is often missing.

Our lightweight MobileNetV2-based approach achieves competitive performance (96% internal accuracy) while maintaining exceptional computational efficiency (45+ images/second, 8.52 MB model).
    
    The rigorous external validation reveals significant domain shift challenges (28% macro-F1 drop), particularly affecting glioma detection. However, our simple domain adaptation strategy—combining external recalibration and threshold optimization—effectively addresses these challenges, improving external performance to 78.4% macro-F1 and dramatically enhancing glioma recall from 23% to 58%.
    
    Key contributions include transparent reporting of external validation with domain shift analysis, practical domain adaptation strategies that avoid catastrophic forgetting, comprehensive calibration assessment with domain-specific solutions, explainable AI with quantitative faithfulness metrics, and detailed efficiency profiling demonstrating deployment readiness.
    
    The pipeline demonstrates that reliable, explainable, and efficient brain tumor classification is achievable with careful attention to validation, calibration, and adaptation strategies. While not yet ready for unsupervised clinical use, the approach provides a solid foundation for real-world evaluation and clinical integration studies.
