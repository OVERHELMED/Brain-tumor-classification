## üíº **COVER LETTER TEMPLATE**

```
Dear Editor,

We submit our manuscript entitled "Efficient and Explainable Brain MRI Tumor Classification: A Lightweight Pipeline with External Validation and Domain Adaptation" for consideration in [Journal Name].

Our work addresses critical gaps in medical AI literature by providing:

1. Rigorous external validation revealing significant domain shift (28% performance drop)
2. Practical domain adaptation strategies improving glioma detection from 23% to 58% recall
3. Comprehensive efficiency profiling demonstrating real-time capability (45+ images/second)
4. Complete reproducibility package with all code and data

The pipeline achieves 96% internal accuracy while maintaining exceptional efficiency (2.22M parameters, 8.52 MB model), making it suitable for real-world clinical deployment.

This work contributes to the medical AI community by providing transparent validation practices, practical adaptation solutions, and deployment-ready efficiency metrics that are essential for clinical translation.

We believe this manuscript aligns with [Journal Name]'s focus on [specific journal focus] and will be of interest to your readers.

Sincerely,
[Author Names]
```

## üîç **REVIEWER RESPONSE STRATEGY**

### **Common Reviewer Concerns & Responses**

#### **"External validation set is small (394 images)"**
**Response**: While the external set is limited, it represents a realistic scenario for external validation studies. We transparently report this limitation and demonstrate that even with limited external data, simple adaptation strategies can significantly improve performance. Future work will include multi-center validation.

#### **"Why not use more recent architectures like Vision Transformers?"**
**Response**: Our focus was on deployment efficiency and real-world applicability. MobileNetV2 provides excellent performance-to-efficiency ratio, achieving 96% accuracy with only 2.22M parameters and real-time inference. Vision Transformers would require significantly more computational resources, limiting clinical deployment feasibility.

#### **"Domain adaptation improvement is modest (67.5% to 78.4%)"**
**Response**: While the overall improvement appears modest, the clinical impact is significant, particularly for glioma detection (23% to 58% recall). This represents a 35% improvement in detecting the most challenging tumor type, which is clinically meaningful.

#### **"Slice-level classification vs volume-level analysis"**
**Response**: Slice-level classification is a common approach in medical imaging literature and provides interpretable results. Volume-level analysis would require 3D architectures with significantly higher computational requirements, limiting deployment feasibility. This represents a trade-off between performance and efficiency.
