# Efficient and Explainable Brain MRI Tumor Classification: A Lightweight Pipeline with External Validation and Domain Adaptation

## Abstract

**Background**: Brain tumor classification from MRI scans is critical for clinical diagnosis, but existing deep learning approaches often lack external validation, calibration assessment, and deployment efficiency reporting—essential for clinical translation.

**Methods**: We developed a lightweight pipeline combining MobileNetV2 feature extraction with classical machine learning classifiers (Logistic Regression, SVM). The pipeline includes rigorous calibration analysis, Grad-CAM explainability, external validation on a separate dataset, and domain adaptation strategies. Efficiency profiling was conducted on standard CPU hardware.

**Results**: Internal validation achieved 96.0% accuracy and 95.8% macro-F1. External validation revealed significant domain shift (67.5% macro-F1), particularly affecting glioma detection (23% recall). Simple domain adaptation via external recalibration and threshold optimization improved external performance to 78.4% macro-F1 and 58% glioma recall. The pipeline demonstrates real-time capability with 45.7 images/second throughput, 2.22M parameters, and 8.52 MB model size.

**Conclusions**: Our lightweight pipeline provides clinically relevant performance with transparent external validation, practical domain adaptation, and deployment-ready efficiency. The approach addresses key gaps in medical AI validation while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for real-world deployment.

## 1. Introduction

Brain tumor classification from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a critical diagnostic task that directly impacts patient care and treatment planning. With the increasing prevalence of brain tumors and the complexity of differential diagnosis, automated classification systems have emerged as promising tools to assist radiologists in clinical decision-making [1,2].

Recent advances in deep learning have demonstrated impressive performance on brain tumor classification tasks, with many studies reporting accuracies exceeding 95% on internal validation sets [3,4]. However, several critical gaps remain in the current literature that limit clinical translation:

### 1.1 Current Limitations

**External Validation Gaps**: Most studies report performance only on internal datasets, with limited external validation on independent datasets from different institutions or imaging protocols [5,6]. This creates an overoptimistic view of real-world performance, as models often exhibit significant performance degradation when applied to external data due to domain shift.

**Calibration Assessment**: While classification accuracy is widely reported, the reliability of predicted probabilities—crucial for clinical decision-making—is rarely assessed [7,8]. Poorly calibrated models can lead to overconfident predictions that misguide clinical decisions.

**Explainability and Trust**: The "black box" nature of deep learning models limits clinical adoption, as radiologists require interpretable explanations for AI-assisted decisions [9,10]. While some studies incorporate explainability methods, quantitative assessment of explanation faithfulness is often missing.

**Deployment Efficiency**: Computational efficiency and deployment requirements are rarely reported, despite being critical for real-world clinical integration [11,12]. Models requiring specialized hardware or extensive computational resources may not be feasible for widespread clinical deployment.

### 1.2 Our Contributions

To address these limitations, we present a comprehensive brain MRI tumor classification pipeline with the following contributions:

1. **Lightweight Architecture**: A MobileNetV2-based feature extractor combined with classical machine learning classifiers, achieving competitive performance with minimal computational requirements.

2. **Rigorous Calibration Analysis**: Comprehensive assessment of prediction reliability using Expected Calibration Error (ECE), Maximum Calibration Error (MCE), and reliability diagrams, with domain-specific calibration strategies.

3. **Explainable AI with Faithfulness Metrics**: Grad-CAM visualization of attention patterns combined with perturbation-based robustness assessment to quantify explanation quality.

4. **External Validation and Domain Shift Analysis**: Systematic evaluation on an independent external dataset, quantifying performance degradation and identifying class-specific vulnerabilities.

5. **Practical Domain Adaptation**: Simple, safe adaptation strategies including external recalibration and threshold optimization that improve external performance without catastrophic forgetting.

6. **Comprehensive Efficiency Profiling**: Detailed computational analysis including parameters, FLOPs, latency, throughput, and memory requirements on standard hardware.

### 1.3 Clinical Relevance

The pipeline addresses four-class brain tumor classification (glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, and no tumor), a clinically relevant task that supports differential diagnosis. The emphasis on external validation, calibration, and efficiency makes this work particularly relevant for clinical translation, where reliability, interpretability, and deployment feasibility are paramount.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Deep Learning for Brain Tumor Classification

Recent studies have explored various deep learning architectures for brain tumor classification. Vision Transformers (ViTs) have gained attention for their ability to capture long-range dependencies in medical images. A 2024 study by Zhang et al. [13] proposed a ViT-GRU hybrid architecture that achieved competitive performance but required significant computational resources and lacked external validation.

MobileNetV2-based approaches have shown promise for efficient medical image analysis. A 2024 study by Kumar et al. [14] combined MobileNetV2 with SVM classifiers, demonstrating good performance with reduced computational requirements. However, this study lacked comprehensive calibration analysis, external validation, and deployment efficiency reporting.

### 2.2 External Validation in Medical AI

External validation has gained increasing attention in medical AI research, with recent guidelines emphasizing the importance of cross-institutional evaluation [15,16]. Studies consistently demonstrate that models trained on single datasets show significant performance degradation when applied to external data, highlighting the critical need for domain adaptation strategies [17,18].

### 2.3 Calibration in Medical AI

Probability calibration has emerged as a crucial component of reliable medical AI systems [19,20]. Recent work has shown that well-calibrated models provide more trustworthy predictions for clinical decision-making, with temperature scaling and Platt scaling being commonly used approaches [21,22].

### 2.4 Explainable AI in Medical Imaging

Explainability methods such as Grad-CAM have been widely adopted in medical imaging [23,24]. However, quantitative assessment of explanation faithfulness remains limited, with most studies relying on qualitative visual inspection rather than rigorous faithfulness metrics [25,26].

## 3. Methods

### 3.1 Dataset Description and Preprocessing

#### 3.1.1 Primary Dataset
We utilized a publicly available brain MRI dataset containing 14,046 images across four classes: glioma (1,621 images), meningioma (1,645 images), pituitary tumors (1,757 images), and no tumor (2,000 images). The dataset was split into training (10,281 images), validation (1,143 images), and test (2,622 images) sets using stratified sampling to maintain class distribution.

#### 3.1.2 External Dataset
For external validation, we used a separate public dataset containing 394 images with the same four-class structure: glioma (100 images), meningioma (115 images), pituitary tumors (74 images), and no tumor (105 images). This dataset was kept entirely separate from the primary dataset to ensure unbiased external validation.

#### 3.1.3 Preprocessing
All images were preprocessed consistently across datasets:
- Resized to 224×224 pixels
- Converted to RGB format
- Normalized using ImageNet statistics (mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
- No data augmentation was applied during feature extraction to ensure reproducibility

### 3.2 Model Architecture

#### 3.2.1 Feature Extraction
We employed MobileNetV2-1.0 as the feature extractor, utilizing the pretrained weights from ImageNet. The model was modified to remove the classification head, outputting 1280-dimensional feature vectors from the global average pooling layer. This approach leverages transfer learning while maintaining computational efficiency.

Grad-CAM visualizations were generated using the pytorch-grad-cam library, targeting the last convolutional layer of MobileNetV2. For each class, we analyzed 10 correctly classified and 5 incorrectly classified test images to understand both successful predictions and failure modes.

#### 3.4.2 Faithfulness Assessment
Explanation faithfulness was quantified using perturbation-based robustness analysis:
- Progressive noise addition to input images
- Measurement of probability change under perturbation
- Calculation of robustness scores for each class

### 3.5 External Validation Protocol

- Domain-specific recalibration using external validation split
- Per-class threshold optimization to improve recall for underrepresented classes
- No model parameter updates to avoid catastrophic forgetting

**Partial Fine-tuning (Negative Ablation)**:
- Unfreezing last two MobileNetV2 blocks
- Fine-tuning on external training data with strong regularization
- Early stopping to prevent overfitting

### 3.6 Efficiency Profiling
